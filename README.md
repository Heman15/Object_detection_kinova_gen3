#Object Detection and Robotic Arm Movement using ROS and MoveIt
This project integrates object detection with robotic arm movement using ROS (Robot Operating System) and MoveIt. It utilizes a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm and Darknet-ROS for object detection, allowing the robotic arm to move to the coordinates of detected objects.
